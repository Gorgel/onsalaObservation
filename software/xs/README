Requirements to compile XS from scratch
------------------------------------------
   1. A C-compiler (gcc, c89, ...). A Fortran compiler for linking
      since the PGPLOT libraries (see below) are Fortran libraries
      (g77, fort77, ...). The egcs compilers work nicely. The new
      gcc-2.95.x compilers work fine too.

   2. You must have all Motif libraries and include files installed
      on your system. On Linux platforms they are usually found
      in /usr/X11R6/lib and /usr/X11R6/include. On HPs usually in
      /usr/lib/Motif1.2 and /usr/include/Motif1.2.
      XS is known to run on Motif version > 1.1.4 (i.e up to and
      including 2.1). For the old version 1.1.4 there are some small
      layout problems (especially with the Gaussian window) but it
      should work. I've never tried older versions than 1.1.4, so
      I would expect problems for such old versions (do any use them?).
      
      For those who do not have Motif, there is a free clone called
      Lesstif (see http://www.lesstif.org/). It is still under
      development, but versions >= 0.89.0 seem to work quite ok.
      There are a few minor layout problems (menu accelerators), at least
      for versions approx 0.90.
      The most recent versions of Lesstif can mimic Motif 1.2, 2.0
      and 2.1. The 2.1 clone (which is one that it is best to use) seems
      to work pretty well for LessTif-0.93.18 which is the latest version
      I have tested.
      
      For Opensource'd platforms (e.g. Linux and *BSD), OpenMotif can
      be used (see http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif). I normally
      build xs against openmotif but I also try to test new LessTif
      versions every now and then.
      
   3. You will also probably need the PGPLOT library (see
      http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot). You'll need the PGPLOT
      libraries libpgplot.(a or so), libcpgplot.a (the C-binder),
      and libXmPgplot.a (the PGPLOT Motif widget support). I
      recommend that you use PGPLOT version >= 5.1.
      It is necessary to link with the PGPLOT libraries if you want
      to be able to save/print PostScript files.  If you want to save
      the plots using GIF and PNG formats, do not forget to include
      the GIF and PNG drivers when installing PGPLOT.
      
   4. XS is known to work under Linux, LinuxPPC, HPUX, Solaris.

How to install XS from source
-----------------------------

 1 Create a directory named xs (or whatever) somewhere

 2 cd into that directory

 3 ftp anonymous login to yggdrasil.oso.chalmers.se.

 4 Get the xs-1.2.x.tar.gz file (in pub/xs)
   
 5 Get the tmp.xsrc file (not really necessary, the .xsrc can
   be created within XS)

 6 quit ftp

 7 gunzip xs-1.2.x.tar.gz

 8 tar xvf xs-1.2.x.tar

 9 cp Makefile.xxx Makefile (depending on your platform)

10 edit the Makefile (by setting the dir where your installed
   executable will be located, the PGPLOT directory, location
   of standard libraries etc, that is, if the libraries aren't
   in the standard places). See also 'Comments on the makefile'
   below.

11 make  (if you are reinstalling xs, use 'make clean' first
   to remove older binaries)

12 make install (only if you want the xs binary in the $BIN_DIR
   directory, make sure you have write permission in $BIN_DIR)

13 cp tmp.xsrc ~/.xsrc (if you already have a .xsrc file you
   can skip this).

14 cd

15 xs  (the program should start, provided that the shell
   can find xs, i.e. $(BIN_DIR) is included in the search path)
   To include /usr/local/bin in a .login (or .cshrc) file, add a line
   like (assuming BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin)
       set path=($path /usr/local/bin)

16 Edit the preferences under 'Prefs'->'Edit preferences'
   When done save the preferences with 'Prefs'->'Save preferences'
   Quit xs (Ctrl-q) and start it again to see if the new preferences
   are loaded as they should.

17 Have fun.  Per (bergman@oso.chalmers.se)


How to install XS from binaries
-------------------------------

Gzipped executables (statically linked) for Linux (i386) and HP workstations
are also available here
      xs-1.2.x-linux-i386.gz
      xs-1.2.x-hp.gz

To extract them use
      gunzip xs-1.2.x-xxx.gz
      mv xs-1.2.x-xxx xs
      chmod a+x xs

Note: When using the binaries without having PGPLOT installed fonts will
      not be drawn in the Postscript viewer. For fonts to be shown you
      must download the PGPLOT package and extract the font info file
      grfont.dat from
           http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot
      and set the environment variable PGPLOT_DIR to the directory where
      the file grfont.dat is placed before using xs. E.g., in case of csh
           setenv PGPLOT_DIR /usr/local/pgplot
      or in the case of bash
           export PGPLOT_DIR=/usr/local/pgplot
      where it is assumed that the PGPLOT font file is located in the
      directory /usr/local/pgplot

Comments on the makefile
------------------------
Don't forget to change the following variables in your Makefile if you
compile the source code from scratch.
    BIN_DIR        The directory where your xs executable should reside
    PGHOME         The directory where the PGPLOT libraries and include
                   files are to be found
    OPTS           There are some extra options that can be used:
    -DBYTESWAP     Define for processors with Intel or Alpha byte order
    -DNO_PGPLOT    Define if you don't need/want PGPLOT. You will not be
                   able to save/print PostScript files.
    XLIB           Change if your X-libraries are elsewhere.
    XINC           Change if your X-includes are elsewhere.
    LIBS           Depending on your system, you may need to add/remove some
                   libraries here. For Motif2.1 on Linux platforms the library
                   -lXp needs to be inserted between -lXm -lXpm. For Motif1.2
                   and 2.0 the libraries in Makefile.linux should suffice.
